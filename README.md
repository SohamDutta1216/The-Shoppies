## Goal
a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

* Remove a nominee from the nomination list

### Features Completed

* [x] Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
* [x] Updates to the search terms should update the result list
* [x] Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
* [x] If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
